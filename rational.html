			<h2>GitHub Links</h2>
			<p>
				In the Rexburgians home page I changed all of the GitHub links
				so that they go directly to the GitHub page and not the GitHub tab.
				<br/>
				The reason I did this is because most people would prefer to
				click their mouse as few times as possible. They want to get there quickly,
				and that's why I reduced the amount of times they have to click to get over to GitHub.
				<br/>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="tab">
			<h2>Spaced HTML Tags</h2>
			<p>
				Several tags were not spaced together, or some tags would start at the same line
				other tags ended. I respaced the tags properly so that the code is more easy to read.
				<br/>
				"Code needs to be legible, follows standard coding guidelines, and commented
				properly so that others may have an easier time reading your code."
				<br/>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="tab">
			<h2>Reorganized Style Tags</h2>
			<p>
				I removed all inline style tags because I think they are clunky and disorganized.
				I moved several in-document styles to styles.css because I thought they were styles that should be shared with other documents.
				The only styles that were left alone were styles that I thought should belong to that page only and no other.
				<br/>
				"Styles should be consistent throughout all of the webpages on your website. They should have a consistent look and theme."
				<br/>

		<div class="tab">
			<h2>Images Jitter a Lot Less in App</h2>
			<p>
				I thought that the images moved around too much and it was more distracting than stylish.
				I made them move a whole lot less, but hope to improve on those transitions through javascript or CSS3.
				<br/>
				"Images should be in the background and not distract the user from the content of the page."
				<br/>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="tab">
			<h2>Changed Email Address in Contact Tab</h2>
			<p>
				I thought
				<a href="mailto:hen14020@byui.edu">hen14020@byui.edu</a>
				would look more professional than
				<a href="mailto:jasonhhotstuff@aol.com">jasonhhotstuff@aol.com</a>
				<br/>
				"Your web page should target the appropriate audience and do as little as it can to offend the user in any way."
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="tab">
			<h2>More Content in Test App Tab</h2>
			<p>
				I added some more information regarding the Mobile App version of Rexburgians
				<br/>
				There is no guideline standard reason why I did this, I just wanted to give more relevant information to the user.
